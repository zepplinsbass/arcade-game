# When Bugs Touch Me, I Die: the Game

## Running the Game
First, clone or download the git repository from github.
Then, open index.html in your browser.

## Object of the Game
Escape the killer bugs. Manuever your character around them and make it to the safety of the
water. (All bugs hate water. Google it.)

## How To Play the Game
1. Upon launching the game, choose a difficulty level.
2. Then, choose a character.
3. Then, move your character to that sweet, sweet H20.
`UP = W or Up Arrow  
DOWN = S or Down Arrow  
RIGHT = D or Right Arrow  
LEFT = A or Left Arrow`  
4. If you get touched by a killer bug, you lose a life. If you lose all
   3 lives, you get a game over screen.
